    "The SNR calculated from the DFT can vary depending on the number of periods analyzed, as the quantization noise can have periodic components that may affect the noise power estimation. To solve this problem, one can use a larger number of samples (more periods) to average out the effects of periodic quantization noise, or apply a window to reduce spectral leakage.\n",

    "The use of a Hanning window can affect the SNR calculated from the DFT, as it can spread the signal power across multiple frequency bins, which can affect the noise power estimation. The SNR may be lower than the theoretical value due to the windowing effect on the signal and noise distribution in the frequency domain.\n",

    "**Part e**/ \n",
    "The addition of noise significantly reduces the SNR calculated from the DFT, as expected. The use of a Hanning window in the presence of noise can further affect the SNR estimation due to the spreading of signal power and noise in the frequency domain, which can lead to a lower SNR than the theoretical value.        \n",
